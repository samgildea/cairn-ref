---

This guide covers the most common workflows for day-to-day use of Stacked PRs, from the standard flow to advanced patterns.

## Working Across Git Worktrees

With Git 2.36+, you can keep separate stacks in linked worktrees or check out different layers of one stack in different worktrees. Stack membership is shared; it does not belong to whichever directory originally created the stack.

### Shared catalog and migration

The catalog is `<common-dir>/gh-stack`, where the common directory is reported by `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir`. In an ordinary clone this is `.git/gh-stack`. gh-stack's rebase and modify recovery journals also live there. Git's HEAD, index, rebase, and cherry-pick markers remain local to each worktree.

On upgrade, gh-stack automatically consolidates nonconflicting legacy catalogs, coalesces equivalent definitions, and preserves originals as backups. Sharing a trunk is fine; conflicting branch membership or stack definitions stop migration and identify the source files. Reconcile the conflicting definitions rather than deleting whichever file looks older. Finish or abort legacy operations in their original worktree before migration, and do not run old and new gh-stack versions against the same clone.

### Separate Git administration directories

Repositories created with `git init --separate-git-dir` keep the administration directory outside the main working directory. Shared storage and main-worktree invocation are supported. Linked worktrees can discover the main owner from an existing absolute or relative `core.worktree` backlink, including one stored in the main worktree's `config.worktree`.

The remaining discovery limitation is **linked invocation without a main-worktree backlink**. In that case, Git may report the administration directory rather than the main working directory. An operation requiring the unresolved main owner fails with actionable guidance to run from the main worktree or supply the backlink; operations on unaffected worktrees continue. Do not `cd` into an administration directory or infer the checkout from its parent directory. gh-stack reads existing backlinks but does not add a private worktree registry or change Git configuration to repair discovery.

### Adopt existing branches

```sh
# Branches can already be checked out in other worktrees
gh stack init auth api frontend
# From the top branch, adopt another existing layer
gh stack add integration
```

Adopting an occupied branch records membership without switching either checkout. The command reports its owning path. `add -m`, `-A`, and `-u` cannot be used to commit or stage in another worktree and are rejected before changing membership or staging files.

### Navigate without stealing a checkout

Ordinary navigation to a foreign-owned branch fails with its path and leaves your checkout unchanged. For shell integration, `up`, `down`, `top`, `bottom`, `trunk`, and **explicit-target** `checkout` accept `--print-path`:

| Target | Successful behavior |
|--------|---------------------|
| Checked out in another worktree | Print its absolute owner path; change neither checkout |
| Unoccupied | Check it out here, then print this worktree's absolute path |
| Already current | Print this worktree's absolute path |

Successful stdout is the raw path plus one newline, with no status text or shell quoting. Diagnostics go to stderr; errors or ambiguous selection leave stdout empty. Path mode never opens a picker, and `checkout --print-path` requires a target.

This Bash/Zsh wrapper checks the command's exit status before changing directories and quotes paths containing spaces:

```sh
gscd() {
  local target
  target=$(gh stack "$@" --print-path) || return $?
  if [ -z "$target" ]; then
    printf '%s\n' 'gh stack returned an empty path' >&2
    return 1
  fi
  cd -- "$target"
}

gscd bottom
gscd checkout api
```

gh-stack does not install shell functions or change your shell's directory. Do not use `eval` or parse human-readable diagnostics for navigation.

### Rebase, sync, and recover

`rebase` and `sync` automatically operate in each affected branch's clean owning worktree. Unoccupied branches are processed in the initiating worktree, whose original checkout is restored afterward. Dirty, busy, missing, or changed affected owners block mutation; unrelated worktrees are left alone. A clean trunk owner can be fast-forwarded, while an unsafe local trunk retains the fetched-remote fallback. gh-stack never auto-stashes, transfers ownership, or creates/removes worktrees.

When a trunk belongs to multiple stacks, selecting one for `rebase`, `sync`, or `modify` does not switch branches. Rebase ranges use the caller's original checkout unless an explicit branch is supplied.

Resolve and stage conflicts in the worktree named by the diagnostic. You can run `gh stack rebase --continue` or `--abort` from any linked worktree: the shared journal routes recovery to the recorded owners. `sync` still restores its cascade on conflicts rather than pushing partial results; completed fetches and earlier fast-forwards are outside that rollback boundary. Recovery retains state and reports any partial failure rather than discarding later edits or claiming a full restoration. Pruning skips branches still occupied in other worktrees.

Finish paused operations before changing gh-stack versions or preview stages. Origin-only journals are explicitly marked; a build that cannot interpret a journal's execution lifecycle must leave it intact. If recovery reports an incompatible lifecycle, use the matching build in the recorded origin to finish or abort it instead of editing or removing the journal.

Legacy recovery remains in its original worktree. Interrupted application or restoration must be aborted; a completed operation retries only its original checkout and catalog publication. Failed restoration, checkout, or publication retains the journal for recovery rather than replaying completed work.

gh-stack serializes mutations across the clone, including independent stacks. Read-only views remain available. A paused rebase or modify journal blocks new gh-stack mutations until recovery. These locks coordinate **gh-stack only**, not arbitrary Git commands, editors, or other tools. Keep affected worktrees quiescent while history is being rewritten. During a pause, make only the requested conflict-resolution edits and staging in the reported worktree; avoid unrelated commits or checkout changes on participating branches.

**Distributed modify:** `modify` supports renaming, inserting, dropping, folding, and reordering branches across worktrees. It preflights affected owners, runs each rename/rewrite in the appropriate worktree, and uses the origin for unoccupied branches. Other worktrees keep their branch choices; dropping/folding a layer preserves its branch and worktree. If the nearest surviving branch is owned elsewhere, the origin keeps its preserved branch and reports the survivor's path. Conflicts are resolved in the reported owner, while `--continue` and `--abort` can be invoked from any linked worktree. See [Restructuring stacks](/gh-stack/guides/modify/).

## Standard Workflow

The basic flow: initialize a stack, add branches for each logical unit of work, commit, push, iterate on review feedback, and merge.

```sh
# 1. Start a stack (creates and checks out the first branch)
gh stack init

# 2. Work on the first layer
# ... write code, make commits ...

# 3. Add the next layer
gh stack add api-routes
# ... write code, make commits ...

# 4. Push everything and create Stacked PRs
gh stack submit

# 5. Reviewer requests changes on the first PR
gh stack bottom
# ... make changes, commit ...

# 6. Rebase the rest of the stack on top of your fix
gh stack rebase

# 7. Push the updated branches
gh stack push

# 8. Land the stack once it's approved (merges bottom to top, atomically)
gh stack merge

# 9. Sync upstream changes as PRs get merged
gh stack sync
```

## Abbreviated Workflow

For speed, use the `-Am` flags to fold staging, committing, and branch creation into a single command. When you don't pass a branch name, one is auto-generated from the commit message in date+slug format (e.g., `03-24-auth_middleware`).

```sh
# Alias `gh stack` as `gs` for easier use
gh stack alias

# 1. Start a stack
gs init auth
#    → creates auth and checks it out

# 2. Write code for the first layer
# ... write code ...

# 3. Stage and commit on the current branch
gs add -Am "Auth middleware"
#    → auth has no commits yet, so the commit lands here

# 4. Write code for the next layer
# ... write code ...

# 5. Create the next branch and commit
gs add -Am "API routes"
#    → auth already has commits, so a new branch is created

# 6. Keep going
# ... write code ...
gs add -Am "Frontend components"
#    → creates another branch

# 7. Push everything and create PRs
gs submit
```

Each `gs add -Am "..."` stages all files, commits, and (if the current branch already has commits) creates a new branch — no separate `git add` or `git commit` needed. Pass an explicit branch name any time you want to control it: `gs add -Am "API routes" api-routes`.

## Making Mid-Stack Changes

When you're working on a higher layer and realize you need to change something lower in the stack — don't hack around it at the current layer. Navigate down, make the change where it belongs, and rebase.

```sh
# You're on feat/frontend but need an API change

# 1. Navigate to the API branch
gh stack down
# or: gh stack checkout api-routes

# 2. Make the change where it belongs
git add users_api.go
git commit -m "Add get-user endpoint"

# 3. Rebase everything above to pick up the change
gh stack rebase --upstack

# 4. Navigate back to where you were working
gh stack top
```

This keeps each branch focused on one concern and avoids muddying the diff for reviewers.

## Responding to Review Feedback

When a reviewer requests changes on a PR mid-stack:

```sh
# 1. Navigate to the branch that needs changes
gh stack checkout auth-middleware
# or: gh stack bottom, gh stack down, etc.

# 2. Make the fixes
git add .
git commit -m "Address review feedback"

# 3. Cascade the changes through the rest of the stack
gh stack rebase

# 4. Push the updated stack
gh stack push
```

The rebase ensures all branches above the changed one pick up the fixes. `gh stack push` uses `--force-with-lease` to safely update the rebased branches.

## Merging Your Stack

When your stack is approved, land it with `gh stack merge`. Regular `gh pr merge` doesn't work with stacked PRs — `gh stack merge` uses GitHub's atomic stack merge, which merges every PR up to and including your chosen one in a single, all-or-nothing operation. If any PR can't be merged, none are.

```sh
# Merge the current stack (interactive picker for how far up to merge)
gh stack merge

# Merge everything up to and including a specific PR
gh stack merge 42

# Merge a stack you don't have checked out, by its stack number
gh stack merge 7

# Merge without prompting for confirmation, specifying the merge method
gh stack merge --yes --squash
```

In an interactive terminal, a short wizard lets you choose how far up the stack to merge, pick the merge method (only the ones your repository allows, defaulting to your last-used method), and confirm — then shows live progress. In a non-interactive terminal, or with `--yes`, the whole stack (or everything up to the given PR) is merged without prompting. After merging, run `gh stack sync` to update your local branches.

If the base branch uses a merge queue, `gh stack merge` adds the stack to the queue instead of merging directly. The queue chooses the merge method, so the wizard skips the method step and any merge method you pass (for example `--squash`) is ignored with a warning. The selected pull requests are added to the queue together but merge as the queue processes them — they may land in separate groups rather than all at once.

Stack merges do not support bypassing merge requirements.

## Syncing After Merges

When a PR at the bottom of the stack is merged on GitHub, use `gh stack sync` to update your local state:

```sh
gh stack sync
```

This command:
1. Fetches the latest changes from the remote
2. Reconciles the remote stack with your local stack
3. Fast-forwards the trunk branch
4. Rebases all remaining stack branches onto the updated trunk
5. Pushes the updated branches
6. Syncs PR state from GitHub
7. Links the open PRs into a Stack on GitHub (creating or updating the remote stack when two or more PRs exist)
8. Prompts to prune local branches for merged PRs (use `--prune` to prune automatically)

If a conflict is detected during the rebase, all branches are restored to their original state, and you're advised to run `gh stack rebase` to resolve conflicts interactively.

### Pulling in PRs added to the stack on GitHub

If PRs are added to the stack on GitHub by someone else, `gh stack sync` fetches the new PRs' branches and appends them to your local stack so it mirrors the remote.

If your local and remote stacks have diverged — for example, you added a branch locally while different PRs/branches were added to the same stack on GitHub — sync can't merge them automatically. In an interactive terminal it offers three choices:

- **Use the remote stack as the source of truth** — replaces your local stack composition with the remote's, pulling any missing branches. If you were on a branch that the remote stack no longer contains, you're moved to the nearest surviving branch. Requires a clean working state with no uncommitted changes.
- **Delete the stack on GitHub** — deletes the stack object on GitHub and stops the sync. Your PRs and local branches are untouched (only the stack on GitHub is removed); recreate the stack with `gh stack submit` (run `gh stack modify` first if you want to change its structure). This is the way to make GitHub match your local stack, because `submit` — unlike `sync` — also creates PRs for any branches you haven't submitted yet.
- **Cancel** — aborts the sync without pushing branches or updating any PRs.

In a non-interactive terminal, a divergence aborts the sync (exit success) without pushing branches or updating PRs; resolve it by unstacking and recreating the stack.

## Rebasing Your Stack

Stacked PRs rely on rebasing rather than merge commits to keep each branch's diff clean and reviewable. If you're coming from a merge-commit workflow, the key difference is: instead of merging upstream changes into your branch (which creates a merge commit with multiple parents), you replay your commits on top of the latest base. The result is a linear history where each PR shows only its specific changes.

### How rebasing works with stacks

When you run `gh stack rebase`, it performs a **cascading rebase**: each branch in the stack is rebased onto the tip of the branch below it, starting from the trunk. This ensures every branch has the latest changes from all lower layers.

```sh
# Rebase the entire stack (all branches, trunk to top)
gh stack rebase

# Only rebase from trunk up to the current branch
gh stack rebase --downstack

# Only rebase from the current branch up to the top
gh stack rebase --upstack

# Rebase stack branches without pulling from or rebasing with trunk
gh stack rebase --no-trunk
```

After rebasing, push the updated branches:

```sh
gh stack push
```

To preserve author dates as committer dates, start with `gh stack rebase --committer-date-is-author-date` (or `--preserve-dates`). This selects Git's merge backend so the date setting survives a conflict. After staging a resolution, use `gh stack rebase --continue`; the continuation uses the settings saved by Git rather than repeating start-only date flags.

`gh stack push` uses `--force-with-lease` to safely update the rebased branches. This is a safe form of force push — it ensures you don't overwrite changes that someone else pushed since your last fetch. If the remote has unexpected changes, the push is rejected and you can investigate.

### Rebase from the CLI vs. the web UI

You can rebase stack branches from either the CLI or the GitHub web UI, but they behave differently:

| | CLI (`gh stack rebase`) | Web UI ("Rebase Stack" button) |
|---|---|---|
| **Runs where** | Locally, using your Git installation | On GitHub's servers |
| **Commit signing** | Commits are signed with your local Git committer config (GPG/SSH signing, if configured) | Commits retain the original author but the committer is set to whoever clicked the button — commits are **not** signed |
| **Conflict resolution** | Interactive — you resolve conflicts in your editor, then `gh stack rebase --continue` | Not available if there are conflicts — you must rebase locally |

:::note
If commit signing matters for your project (e.g., branch protection rules require signed commits), use the CLI for rebases.
:::

### Resolving conflicts

When a rebase encounters a conflict, `gh stack rebase` stops and tells you which files are conflicted:

```sh
gh stack rebase
# ✗ Conflict detected rebasing feat/api onto feat/auth
#   C api/routes.go (lines 12–18)
#
# Resolve conflicts on feat/api, then run: gh stack rebase --continue
# Or abort this operation with: gh stack rebase --abort
```

To resolve:

```sh
# 1. Open the conflicted files and resolve the markers
#    (<<<<<<< / ======= / >>>>>>>)
#    Use your editor of choice

# 2. Stage the resolved files
git add api/routes.go

# 3. Continue the rebase — remaining branches are rebased automatically
gh stack rebase --continue
```

If the conflict is too complex or you want to start over:

```sh
# Abort and restore all branches to their pre-rebase state
gh stack rebase --abort
```

### The rebase + force-push cycle

The typical cycle when updating a stack after making changes looks like this:

```sh
# 1. Make changes on a mid-stack branch
gh stack checkout feat/auth
git add .
git commit -m "Fix token validation"

# 2. Rebase everything above to incorporate the change
gh stack rebase --upstack

# 3. Push all updated branches (safe force push)
gh stack push
```

This is equivalent but distinct from updating your branch using a merge commit. The key difference is that after changing a lower branch, rebase maintains a linear commit history so the unique set of commits on each branch have clean diffs.

`gh stack push` then handles the force push with explicit per-branch `--force-with-lease` checks. The multi-branch push is not atomic: branches whose leases pass may update even if another branch is rejected. Fix the rejected branch and rerun the command; branches already updated will be unchanged.

For a simpler all-in-one flow, `gh stack sync` combines fetch, rebase, and push into a single command — useful when you just need to pull in the latest upstream changes:

```sh
gh stack sync
```

## Existing Branches into a Stack

If you already have a set of branches that form a logical chain, you can organize them into a stack by passing them to `gh stack init`. Existing branches are adopted automatically — no special flags needed.

```sh
# Adopt three existing branches into a stack (bottom to top)
gh stack init feat/auth feat/api feat/ui
```

The order matters: branches are listed from bottom (closest to trunk) to top (furthest from trunk). Any PRs already open for these branches are detected and linked to the stack.

You can also mix existing and new branches in one command:

```sh
# feat/auth exists, feat/api-v2 will be created
gh stack init feat/auth feat/api-v2
```

After organizing branches into a stack, run `gh stack submit` to create a Stack on GitHub and link the PRs together.

```sh
# View the new stack
gh stack view

# Create/update PRs and link them as a Stack on GitHub
gh stack submit
```

## Structuring Your Stack

Think of a stack from the reviewer's perspective: the PRs should tell a **cohesive story**. A reviewer reading the PRs in sequence should understand the progression of changes.

### Dependency order

Plan your layers before writing code. Foundational changes go in lower branches, dependent changes go higher:

```
     ┌── tests          ← integration tests for the full stack
    ┌── frontend-ui      ← UI components that call the APIs
   ┌── api-endpoints     ← API routes that use the models
  ┌── data-models        ← shared types, database schema
main (trunk)
```

### When to create a new branch

Create a new branch (`gh stack add`) when you're starting a **different concern**:

- Switching from backend to frontend work
- Moving from core logic to tests or documentation
- The next changes have a different reviewer audience
- The current branch is already large enough to review

### One stack, one effort

All branches in a stack should be part of the same feature or project. If you need to work on something unrelated, start a separate stack with `gh stack init` or switch to an existing one with `gh stack checkout`.

## Restructuring a Stack

When you need to change the composition of a stack — remove a branch, combine branches, insert a new branch, change the order, or rename a branch — use `gh stack modify`:

```sh
# Open the modify TUI
gh stack modify

# In the TUI:
#   x     → drop a branch
#   d     → fold down (into branch below)
#   u     → fold up (into branch above)
#   i     → insert below
#   I     → insert above
#   Shift+↓/↑ → reorder
#   r     → rename
#   z     → undo
#   Ctrl+S → apply changes
#   q     → cancel

# After modifying, push changes to remote and recreate the stack on GitHub
gh stack submit
```

### Common restructuring scenarios

**Remove a branch and its unique commits from the stack:**
1. `gh stack modify`
2. Navigate to the branch, press `x` to mark it for drop
3. Press `Ctrl+S` to apply
4. `gh stack submit`

**Combine two branches into one:**
1. `gh stack modify`
2. Navigate to the branch you want to fold
3. Press `d` to fold its commits into the branch below, or `u` to fold into the branch above
4. Press `Ctrl+S` to apply
5. `gh stack submit`

**Reorder branches:**
1. `gh stack modify`
2. Navigate to the branch to move
3. Press `Shift+↓` to move down or `Shift+↑` to move up
4. Press `Ctrl+S` to apply
5. `gh stack submit`

## Using AI Agents with Stacks

AI coding agents (like GitHub Copilot) can create and manage Stacked PRs on your behalf. Install the gh-stack skill to give them the context they need:

```sh
gh skill install github/gh-stack
```

Or if you prefer to use `npx skills`:

```sh
npx skills add github/gh-stack
```

With the skill installed, your agent can:
- Plan stack structure based on the work being done
- Create branches and commit changes in the right layers
- Navigate between branches to make mid-stack changes
- Push branches and create Stacked PRs
- Rebase after making changes to lower layers
